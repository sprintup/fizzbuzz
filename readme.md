The [first step](https://github.com/sprintup/fizzbuzz/commit/252882ba6b2a5809b56bedd13929f0e17ed13099) was done without Maven.
More details are [here](https://github.com/sprintup/fizzbuzz/blob/252882ba6b2a5809b56bedd13929f0e17ed13099/test/com/adaction/fizzbuzz/Step_1_Tests.java#L81)

I understand how the pom file is important to configuring microservices, so before the second step, I followed: 
https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html

For step 2, I just copied the code from step 1 into the new Maven project. 

For step 3, I'll check out a new branch and submit a pull request.
