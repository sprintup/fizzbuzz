This is my first time programming in Java, so I did some stuff differently than I would with a language and tools I'm more familiar with. 

The [first step](https://github.com/sprintup/fizzbuzz/commit/252882ba6b2a5809b56bedd13929f0e17ed13099) was done without Maven, I was just using command line and IntelliJ IDE. Therefor, the two paths to fizzbuzz from the root directory are not attached to a project. 
More details are [here](https://github.com/sprintup/fizzbuzz/blob/252882ba6b2a5809b56bedd13929f0e17ed13099/test/com/adaction/fizzbuzz/Step_1_Tests.java#L81)

I understand how the pom file is important to configuring microservices, so before the second step, I followed: 
https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html

For step 2, I just copied the code from step 1 into the new Maven project (my-app) 

For step 3, I'll check out a new branch and submit a pull request.
